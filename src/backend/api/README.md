# NovaFlux Automator API surface

This directory isolates backend-facing code for the GitHubStarter playground. The existing Swift client in `src/frontend/GitHubStarter.playground/Contents.swift` builds authenticated `URLRequest` payloads to the NovaFlux Automator API.

Use this space to add reusable API helpers, mock responses, or future service integrations without coupling them to the UI entry points.

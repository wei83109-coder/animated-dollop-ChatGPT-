# NovaFlux Automator — 2-minute intro video script

## Tone and pacing
- Duration: ~120 seconds. Keep a calm but confident delivery; 110–115 words per minute.
- Visual language: liquid-glass UI inspired by iOS 18/visionOS — blurred panels, soft gradients, depth shadows.

## Structure
1. **Hook (0:00–0:15)**
   - Visual: Rapid montage of an overflowing inbox, then a hand tapping the NovaFlux button in the playground.
   - Narration: "Your GitHub to-do list keeps growing. NovaFlux Automator turns Codex into your on-device co-pilot—no laptop required."

2. **Core value (0:15–0:45)**
   - Visual: Glassmorphic cards floating; one highlights GitHub notifications, another shows a PR checklist.
   - Narration: "NovaFlux drafts replies, triages issues, and shares ready-to-use prompts from your clipboard. Everything runs securely from Swift Playgrounds on iPhone or iPad."

3. **How to use (0:45–1:20)**
   - Steps on screen with subtle blur and neon borders:
     1. "Open `GitHubStarter.playground` and tap **Run**."
     2. "Configure your API: set `NOVFLUX_API_BASE` and `NOVFLUX_API_KEY` to your live endpoint and key." (Display the sample https://api.novaflux.example/v1 and `nova-demo-key-please-replace` as defaults.)
     3. "Tap **Trigger NovaFlux automation** to generate responses, then share or copy them."
     4. "Use quick actions to paste PR review checklists and issue templates anywhere."
   - Narration: "In one tap, NovaFlux builds an authenticated request, sends it, and brings back drafts you can ship."

4. **Why it matters (1:20–1:45)**
   - Visual: Split screen — left shows coding on a Mac; right shows mobile triage freeing up time.
   - Narration: "Stop waiting to get back to your desk. Handle GitHub reviews, docs, and handoffs from your phone with the same polish as desktop."

5. **Call to action (1:45–2:00)**
   - Visual: Liquid-glass hero with a bright CTA button.
   - Narration: "Download the playground, drop in your API key, and let NovaFlux automate the busywork. The fastest way to stay in flow—wherever you are."

## On-screen supers & captions
- Use short, legible supers: "Liquid-glass UI", "One-tap automations", "Clipboard quick actions".
- Add a lower-third for the API details: `NOVFLUX_API_BASE=https://api.novaflux.example/v1` and `NOVFLUX_API_KEY=nova-demo-key-please-replace` with a note to swap in a live key.

## Music & SFX
- Ambient electronic bed at ~90–100 BPM; gentle chimes for button taps; subtle whoosh on scene transitions.

## Safety note
- Remind viewers that live calls require a valid API key and that demo defaults avoid real requests.
